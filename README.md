It's a new version of [LinkeTinder2](https://github.com/quartzolit/ZG-LinkeTinder2)

## Front-END

On this version we created the front END using Angular JS

## Back END

We've created login and signup feature using Spring Framework

Also created Vacancy feature using Grails frame work (Need improvements)

## Tests

Nothing implemented yet. Want to use Spock to test our methods

## Documentation
